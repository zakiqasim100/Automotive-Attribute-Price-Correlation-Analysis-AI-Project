#Project Title: Automotive Attribute-Price Correlation Analysis

Through data preprocessing, understand the crucial relationship between vehicle attributes and
prices, essential for consumers and pricing strategies.
Factors such as color, transmission type, model year, 4-wheel drive, etc are analyzed to
determine what price range gives you what vehicle with which features, and vice versa,
facilitating informed decisions in the automotive market for both buyer and seller.

Problem Statement

The aim of this project is to conduct an in-depth analysis of the correlation between various
attributes of vehicles and their corresponding prices using a dataset sourced from car
advertisements. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we seek to uncover insights into
how factors such as color, transmission type, condition, odometer, and others influence the
pricing of vehicles in the market. It also reveals that on what price you can get what type of
features, by analyzing thousands of observations and several characteristics.

Importance of the Project

Understanding the relationship between vehicle attributes and prices is crucial for both
consumers and industry professionals.
Consumers can make more informed decisions when purchasing vehicles, while industry
players can gain insights into market trends, customer preferences, and pricing strategies.
Additionally, this analysis can aid in optimizing advertising campaigns and inventory
management for automotive businesses.

Dataset Description

The dataset comprises car advertisements sourced from various online platforms. It includes
attributes such as color, transmission type, mileage, model year, condition, and price, among
others.
The dataset requires preprocessing to handle missing values, standardize data types, and
improve data quality before conducting the analysis.
The dataset comprises of thousands of observations and several characteristics. Several
missing values are found. No explicit duplicate is found. And several data have mismatch type.

Preprocessing of Data

1. Handling missing values: Replace missing values with appropriate measures such as
median or mode based on relevant parameters.
2. Data type conversion: Convert data types to ensure consistency and suitability for
analysis.
3. Feature engineering: Create new features to facilitate analysis, such as calculating the
age of vehicles and categorizing attributes.
4. Outlier detection and treatment: Identify and handle outliers to prevent skewed
analysis results.

Integration with Webpage

The project will include the development of a webpage that integrates the machine learning
model for analyzing the correlation between vehicle attributes and prices.
Users will be able to input specific attributes of interest and receive insights into the expected
price range based on the selected criteria. The webpage will provide an intuitive interface for
users to interact with the model and visualize the analysis results.

Conclusion

By conducting a comprehensive analysis of the correlation between automotive attributes and
prices, this project aims to provide valuable insights for consumers and industry professionals in
the automotive sector.

The integration of a webpage will enhance accessibility and usability, enabling users to leverage
AI-powered tools for informed decision-making in vehicle purchasing and market analysis.
